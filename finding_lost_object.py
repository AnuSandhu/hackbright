print ("Finding lost objects with the help of numbers is an old and proven method of tapping into your subconscious.  As with other aspects of life where the relationship between cause and effect is obscured, doubts have no effect on the reality of what takes place.  Hence, if you find it difficult to create a nine-digit number, perhaps because you feel too self-conscious, changing your mind ten times in the process, remember that no matter how you reach the final number, it is the number that tells all.  Period.")
